**Problem 1**
```{r}
bday_function = function(n) {
  bday <- sample(1:365, n, replace = TRUE)
  if (length(unique(bday)) < n) {
    return(TRUE)  
  } else {
    return(FALSE) 
  }
} 

bday_prob = function(max_group_size, simulations = 10000) {
  prob = numeric(max_group_size - 1)
  for (n in 2:max_group_size) {
    results <- replicate(simulations, bday_function(n))
    prob[n - 1] <- mean(results)  
  }
  return(prob)
  }

group_sizes = 2:50
prob = bday_prob(50)

bday_prob_data = data.frame(Group_Size = group_sizes, Probability = prob)

ggplot(bday_prob_data, aes(x = Group_Size, y = Probability)) +
  geom_line() + 
  geom_point() 
```

The graph shows that there is a positive association between group size and probability that two people share a birthday. 


**Problem 2**
```{r}
q2_t_test = function(mu, iterations = 5000) { 
  replicate(iterations, {
    data <- rnorm(n = 30, mean = mu, sd = 5)
    t_test <- t.test(data, mu = 0) 
    broom::tidy(t_test)  
  }, simplify = FALSE) |>
    bind_rows() |>
    mutate(mu = mu)
}

values = c(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) 

q2_results = map_dfr(values, q2_t_test) 

q2_power = q2_results |>
  group_by(mu) |>
  summarize(
    mean_estimate = mean(estimate),
    power = mean(p.value < 0.05)
  )

q2_power
```


```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(q2_power, aes(x = mu, y = power)) + 
  geom_point()
```

Effect size and Power have a positive association. As the true value of mu increases, the difference between the true mu value and the null hypothesized value increases as well, which is known as the effect size. This makes it more feasible to detect a difference, which increases power. This is reflected in the graph above, as the true value of mu increases with power. 


```{r}
null_rejected = q2_results |>
  group_by(mu) |>
  summarize(
    mean_rejected = mean(estimate[p.value < 0.05], na.rm = TRUE)  
  )

q2 = q2_power |>
  left_join(null_rejected, by = "mu")

q2
```

```{r}
plot1 = ggplot(q2, aes(x = mu)) +
  geom_line(aes(y = mean_estimate), color = "red",linetype = "solid") +
  geom_point(aes(y = mean_estimate), color = "red")
plot1

plot2 = plot1 + geom_line(aes(y = mean_rejected), color = "yellow", linetype = "dashed") +
  geom_point(aes(y = mean_rejected), size = 3, color = "yellow") 

plot2
```

The sample average of 𝜇̂ across tests for which the null is rejected is not approximately equal to the true value of 𝜇 because of selection bias. The sample average of  𝜇̂ for which the null is rejected has selection bias as observations are selected based on the condition that the null was rejected, where this is not the case for the true value of 𝜇.


**Problem 3**
```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(readr)

homicide_data = read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/washingtonpost/data-homicides/refs/heads/master/homicide-data.csv")

homicide_data = homicide_data |>
  mutate(city_state = paste(city, state, sep = ", "))

summary = homicide_data |>
  group_by(city_state) |>
  summarize(
    total = n(),  
    unsolved = sum(disposition %in% c("Closed without arrest", "Open/No arrest"))  
  )
summary
``` 

```{r}
baltimore = homicide_data |>
  filter(city_state == "Baltimore, MD")

prop_test = prop.test(
  x = sum(baltimore[["disposition"]] %in% c("Closed without arrest", "Open/No arrest")), 
  n = nrow(baltimore)) |>
  broom::tidy() 

proportion_estimate = prop_test |>
  pull(estimate) 

conf_interval = prop_test |>
  select(conf.low, conf.high)
```

```{r}
city_prop_tests <- homicide_data |>
  group_by(city_state) |>
  summarise(
    results = list(prop.test(
      x = sum(disposition %in% c("Closed without arrest", "Open/No arrest")),
      n = n()
    ))
  ) |>
  mutate(
    tidy = purrr::map(results, broom::tidy)
  ) |>
  unnest(cols = c(tidy)) |>
  select(city_state, estimate, conf.low, conf.high)
``` 

```{r}
city_plot <- city_prop_tests |>
  arrange(desc(estimate)) |>  
  mutate(city_state = factor(city_state, levels = city_state)) |>  
  ggplot(aes(x = city_state, y = estimate)) +
  geom_point(size = 0.5) +  
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = conf.low, ymax = conf.high), width = 0.1) +
  coord_flip() + 
  theme_minimal() + 
  theme(
    axis.text.y = element_text(size = 4))

city_plot  
```
